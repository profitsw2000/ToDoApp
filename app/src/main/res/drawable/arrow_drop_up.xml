<!--
    M or m (X,Y)+
    moveto: Move cursor to position, uppercase is absolute, lowercase is relative moveto commands are followed by X,Y coordinates. There can be more than one set of coordinates following an M command, these are treated as implicit lineto commands.

    Z or z
    closepath: Draws a line from the current position of the cursor to the start position of the path. Does not have any parameters.

    L or l (X,Y)+
    lineto: Draws a line from the current position to the position specified by X,Y. Uppercase means absolute coordinates, lowercase means relative coordinates. You can have more than one set of coordinates following a lineto command. If you want specify more than one set of coordinates, it means that youâ€™re creating a polyline (shape consisting of multiple string lines).

    H or h (X)+
    Horizontal lineto draws a horizontal line from the current cursor position to the position specified by X. If there are multiple X coordinates following the command, this is treated as a polyline. The Y coordinate remains unchanged. Uppercase H is absolute coordinates, lowercase h is relative coordinates.

    V or v (Y)+
    Vertical lineto draws a vertical line from the current cursor position to the position specified by Y. If there are multiple Y coordinates following the command, this is treated as a polyline. The X coordinate remains unchanged. Uppercase V is absolute coordinates, lowercase v is relative coordinates.-->
